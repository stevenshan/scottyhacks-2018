Or, as others argue in the name of actually existing democracies, should we embrace difference as a resource, value conflict and counterpublics as a way to circulate new ideas and identities, and replace the norms of formal rationality with a demand for reasoning, open to the non-elite discourses of narrative and testimony, moral advocacy and emotion? In this course, we will combine this energetic theoretical discussion of the public sphere with a look at the grounded practice of local publics that emerge in workplaces, web forums, grassroots or civic groups, and community think tanks. Since counterpublics and local publics enter the arc of controversy well before the more formal process of writing legislation or policy, we will be asking how they carry out the rhetorical work of creating a public controversy, of framing (or re-framing) problems, and of dealing with social, economic and cultural difference.

The second part reinforces these fundamentals, and introduce students to parametric work flows in digital fabrication, namely, coupling CNC fabrication with parametric modeling for mass-customization, high-volume design iteration, and custom detailing; using digital workflows to describe, organize, and construct geometrically complex and dimensionally unique components; and using 3D digital modeling to efficiently produce component without the need for 2D representation. Adjusting global forms can automatically update individual components. The course consists of lectures, computer cluster instruction and work/instruction in the dFab lab.

Although businesses give much lip-service to customer satisfaction, too many of these businesses do a poor job of attracting, serving, or retaining these customers. Instead, many companies have overly focused on inserting technology interfaces while under-serving the customer.  Or, they have focused on how they want to approach/manipulate the customer rather than on what the customer wants from the interaction.    This course explores the concepts of customer service and customer-driven within the context of service, e-commerce, and other companies.  It will examine what companies must do to attract, keep, and get repeat business from highly satisfied customers.  It will explore how traditional businesses accomplish these goals and whether traditional concepts/tools apply to e-commerce companies.  When possible, it will highlight traditional and e-commerce companies that provide positive and negative examples.    The course will also distinguish between e-commerce companies that provide a service and those that are customer-driven arms for manufacturing companies.  Even some manufacturing companies (e.g. autos and computers) that traditionally were production or technology driven now find competitive advantage in being customer-driven.  (Ford Motor changed its company slogan from Quality if 1 at Ford to The Customer is 1 at Ford.)  As these companies move into an e-commerce environment, it may require a re-thinking of their business and approach to customers.    Topics that may be included are:      What does it mean to be customer-driven for any business?      How do you (or should you) make your firm more customer-driven?

Extended Project Course Sequence (EPCS): The EPCS is a thread that runs through the MS-RTs two semesters during Year-One at a partner institution, two semesters during Year-Two on the CMU-Pittsburgh campus, and the summer between the two academic years. It is a research experience intended to prepare international professional masters degree students in robotics for future entrepreneurial careers in their home countries. Its aim is less to require that they personally augment humanitys knowledge base, as would be required in an academic/research degree program, and more to teach them how to evaluate others research for its entrepreneurial potential, and to learn the process for transitioning it from a university lab to a position of economic value and social benefit. The five course modules of the sequence are identified as prepare, plan, execute, analyze, and present. Prepare  means to develop a high-level understanding of the research-with-a-goal architecting process. Plan means to identify, propose, and schedule the intended course of a specific project. Execute means to obtain data, preferably with an industrial sponsor identified in the plan  segment, but potentially alternatively in a university research lab.  Analyze means to draw defensible conclusions from the data, and accordingly to plan a commercialization route. Present is the professional programs alternative to a research thesis: students present their conclusions and future plans in several different formats each targeting a different clearly identified dissemination medium and audience interest, for example, written and orally presented versions of a professional magazine article, a trade show poster presentation, an engineering teams technical report, and a pitch to a venture capital source.", "department": "SCS: Robotics", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "MS-RT Extended Project Course Sequence (EPCS)", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "C", "times": [{"building": "NSH", "begin": "04:30PM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "3002", "end": "06:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Kantor, George"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": null, "sections": []}, "57-512": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "A one hour private lesson per week for all music majors.", "department": "Music", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Major Studio (Clarinet)", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "DNM", "begin": null, "days": null, "room": "DNM", "end": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Thompson, Thomas"]}, {"name": "B", "times": [{"building": "DNM", "begin": null, "days": null, "room": "DNM", "end": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Rusinek, Michael", "Reeder, Zachary", "Johnston, Sharon"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 9.0, "sections": []}, "24-781": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "24-781 This project course is the first section of the two-semester sequence of Computational Engineering Projects.

We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools supporting quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics   the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments.

In early sixteenth century Europe, race was a complex system of power distribution that relied primarily on religious or rank-based difference. With the development of colonization and color-based slavery in the Atlantic world, the early modern racial matrix produced a new paradigm: Europeans started thinking about physiological difference - for which skin color was a shorthand - in racial terms too. How were those various racial paradigms (religion, rank, skin color) represented in one of the most important mass media of the time - theatre? How did those paradigms interact in one given play or one given national culture? Did they reinforce or work against one another? Which features were specific to nationally defined racial epistemes? Which features circulated across national borders? How did the translation and mistranslation of racial notions from one culture into another shape a sense of shared whiteness in early modern Europe? Which performance techniques did actors use to impersonate racial others, and what effect did those techniques have on spectators? In short, how did early modern theatre participate in the making of race? To answer those questions, we will focus on a rich corpus of plays staging Jews, Moors and Blackamoors, New World Indians, Gypsies, and Turks.

What began as primarily theological concerns for Martin Luther and his supporters quickly morphed into political concerns that changed forever the face of Europe and eventually the New World.  The consequences of Luthers Reformation can be seen even today.   In this course we will deal with questions such as the way Luthers words and works addressed political and ecclesiastical authorities as well as the individual citizen.  We will also consider the multi-sided personality and talents of Martin Luther, one of the most colorful figures in German history.  We will view not only Luther the theologian, but also Luther the song writer and propagandist, the teacher and mentor, the translator, the preacher, and last but not least, Luther the husband and father of six children.  To gain insight into Luthers unusual biography, we will read portions of the famous (infamous?) Tischreden, which are accounts of his personal conversations with his many students at the university in Wittenberg, and view several dramatic films about Luthers life that have been produced in recent decades.

The emphasis of the classes on descriptive statistics is the calculation and interpretation of summary statistical measures for describing raw data. The sessions on statistical inference are designed to provide you with the background for executing and interpreting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. The final component of the course focuses on regression analysis a widely used statistical methodology.

Every imaginable type of criminal activity has been depicted on screen, as have the legal ramifications of those acts. But these films raise profound questions. What is the nature of crime?

How do sculptures spark action, violence, or change? This advanced studio course engages the present moment in which making bodies present in public space is considered an urgent political objective, and takes contemporary debates on the toppling of monuments as a starting point for discussions on the potent materiality of sculpture. Structured around readings, slide talks, independent research, individual meetings and group critiques, as well as field visits to local sites, this course will investigate the properties and origins of sculpture materials in order to reveal hidden meanings and latent possibilities. In which moments do materials become willful actors and agents within artistic processes? How can they obstruct, disrupt, or interfere with social norms? How do materials and processes harbor traces of human activity and touch? Sculpture can be considered as a physical obstacle in space, while at the same time suggesting a world of the living. We will explore the relationship between the uncanny qualities of figurative sculpture, the physical act of making as a performative gesture, and the notions of consciousness, awakening, and eros in the direct experience of sculpture. In this course we will mine a dynamic array of artists who use material culture as raw material and read from texts that theorize matter as vibrant, running through and across bodies, both human and nonhuman. Through a series of project prompts, we will reflect on a range of related themes: the physicality of perception, the bodily relationship between works and their receivers, sensory aspects of sculpture that go beyond the physical, the emotional identification of sculpture as a perceptual event, the intertwining of the psychic and the phenomenological, and the relationship of desire to the body and to things.", "department": "Art", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "TBA", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "DH", "begin": "08:30AM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "C200", "end": "11:20AM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Smith, Allison"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 10.0, "sections": []}, "54-407": {"prereqs": "54-207 and 54-208", "desc": "Movement IV is a cross-option course, wherein Sophomore Designers build masks for the Senior Actors to use in the creation of a movement mask piece based on a classic text.

During that lecture, he had declared drawing dead for architects-this despite the fact that the most compelling explanations he made during his talk were done with rather good gestural drawings.  It had seemed to me that the work he showed lacked formal order, complexity, scale and proportion (goo would be a good word for my sense of it), and I have speculated ever since that a course in classical anatomy would be helpful in addressing those weaknesses in their idiom.  Closer to home, I began to think it would be important for our students because they (as all students do) will tend to pursue the formal clichs of our time: Maynes, Patrick Schumacher etc.    In effect, there is an assumption behind this course: that through drawing that focuses consciously upon the formal order of real organic conditions, we can come to assimilate a sense of that order in a way that can make it ultimately transferrable to design.  A more near-term goal is that by drawing organic shapes and forms, students will gain strength in understanding the geometry of non-rectilinear shapes and strengthen their ability to visualize them.    This course is a studio drawing course centered on figure-drawing.  Prescribed media are limited-charcoal and cont principally-and may be supplemented by students as desired.

Part 3 adds tissue, muscle and tendon, to consider whole systems of the human body.  Within part three is an in-depth project focusing on a subject of a students own choice.

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.

It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).  Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU).

When we speak, the language we use positions us in multiple ways: as members of one or more linguistic communities; as belonging to various social, economic, and educational classes; as more or less socially distant; as more or less powerful in relation to other people; and so on. The overarching goal of this course is to conceptualize French as an act of identity. To this end, we will examine the ways in which variation in word choice, grammar, and discourse beyond the sentence level indexes, or points to, speakers and writers performed identities in relation to their intended audiences. Learning outcomes for the course are twofold: 1) students will develop their awareness of the linguistic and discursive practices that index identity performance; 2) students will develop their abilities to use relevant linguistic and discursive practices to index their own identities in French.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis.

(source: Don Schultz).  IMC is specifically designed to ensure that all communication strategies and messages are unified and integrated across all channels and, importantly, begin with the consumer/customer.  It is critical that marketers understand the limitations of marcom tactics as well as how to best leverage and integrate marcom tactics for the strongest, most consistent and authentic brand voice in the targeted marketplace.  The entire IMC process is driven by the customer, and in the case of our discussions in this class, the consumer.   The course is designed to help students understand the integrated marketing communications model, the strategy and tools of the marketing mix and what makes an iconic brand.  The course is designed in five sections:  Part One focuses on understanding brands - iconic brands, terminology and types of branding.  Part Two focuses on the understanding of consumer behavior - one of the, if not the most critical part of understanding marketing.  Brands are built and defined in the minds of consumers.     Part Three focuses on IMC and the framework used by brand management to develop strategy, and understand audience segmentation and brand positioning to drive IMC.    Part Four focuses on understanding the IMC tactics available to marketers including advertising, social media and digital marketing, events and public relations.

This course will draw from readings on independent theatre, interviews with working independent producers in New York, and the working experience of Anderson Cook, author/producer of The Disembodied Hand That Fisted Everyone to Death - the Musical, Blatantly Blaine, Pop Punk High, Donny and Kelly Save the Slumber Valley ASPCA, and more - all produced and reviewed in NYC.", "department": "Drama", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "The Basics of Self-Producing: How to Put Up Your Show in NYC and Get It Reviewed", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A1", "times": [{"building": "PCA", "begin": "03:00PM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "231", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Cook, Anderson"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0, "sections": []}, "85-370": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "Perception, broadly defined, is the construction of a representation of the external world for purposes of thinking and acting.

Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.

This expectation has far reaching effects, including on the assignment of referents to pronouns, the interpretation of definite and indefinite noun phrases, assignment of temporal relations, and the identification of Gricean conversational implicatures.

These novels continue to captivate audiences and have inspired innumerable adaptations in theater, film, and television. This course will examine the fertile century that yielded these masterpieces. In addition to the novels mentioned above, students will encounter texts by writers who may be less well known but are no less significant, including Pushkin, Lermontov, and Turgenev. We will consider the social and cultural circumstances in which these works were produced and reflect on the reasons these Russian masterpieces have appealed to audiences well beyond the Russian-speaking world. By analyzing some of Russias key cultural achievements, students will come to better understand contemporary Russian society and its place in world culture.     Students will be asked to critically analyze literary and historical texts, participate actively in class discussions, and write three short essays. This is a 9-unit course taught in English.

CC: With the growing number of massive datasets in applications such as machine learning and numerical linear algebra, classical algorithms for processing such datasets are often no longer feasible. In this course we will cover algorithmic techniques, models, and lower bounds for handling such data. A common theme is the use of randomized methods, such as sketching and sampling, to provide dimensionality reduction. In the context of optimization problems, this leads to faster algorithms, and we will see examples of this in the form of least squares regression and low rank approximation of matrices and tensors, as well as robust variants of these problems. In the context of distributed algorithms, dimensionality reduction leads to communication-efficient protocols, while in the context of data stream algorithms, it leads to memory-efficient algorithms. We will study some of the above problems in such models, such as low rank approximation, but also consider a variety of classical streaming problems such as counting distinct elements, finding frequent items, and estimating norms. Finally we will study lower bound methods in these models showing that many of the algorithms we covered are optimal or near-optimal. Such methods are often based on communication complexity and information-theoretic arguments.

This will allow students to learn the material at their own pace, and to translate theory to practice in a group setting with mentorship of the course instructor and teaching assistant, and teamwork of classmates. Throughout the semester, specific problems will be assigned to the entire class on topics emphasizing cost saving (affordable health care act), medicine for under-resourced settings, and global health. A final project will be required of each student on a topic of choice (with instructor approval.) Each project will have an associated client from industry or healthcare who will serve as outside reviewer. The composition of the class will emphasize biomedical engineering students, but will also invite a limited enrollment of students from the School of Design, Tepper, and Heinz. Accordingly, there will be emphasis on multi-disciplinary teamwork, and networking. In summary, the goals of this course are to: develop formal skills in inventive problem solving, gain proficiency in teamwork and networking, and to actually solve real-world problems in medicine.

Prerequisites: successful completion of 48-116, 48-215 and 48-315 or their equivalent is expected.  No prior knowledge of active commercial systems and systems integration is assumed, but students are expected to understand heating and cooling load calculations, to be able to identify factors in building design that affect those loads, and to quantify their impact.  A basic understanding of daylighting and electric lighting principles as covered in 48-116 and 48-315 is also assumed.", "department": "Architecture", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Environment II: Design Integration of Active Building Systems", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "BH", "begin": "09:00AM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "136A", "end": "10:20AM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Baird, Nina"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 9.0, "sections": []}, "67-331": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "This course is by invitation only for participants in the Technology Consulting in the Global Community program.

FALL 2017: Comics in the Digital Humanities: Coding Electronic Textualities - Comics (from cartoons to comic strips and books, to graphic novels) are types of text defined by a wide variety of content and intricate relationships between the pictorial and the textual. Latin American comics have steadily informed and transformed the mass-media and cultural landscapes for decades, and have become the object of serious scholarly attention in the humanities --most recently in the digital humanities. This course explores a corpus of selected comics with a focus upon what they can tell us about articulations of identity, society, culture, and community in Hispanic Latin America. We will read theory and criticism to help deepen our understanding of each work and the context in which it was produced. We will also use hands-on instruction in Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, for encoding and analyzing the structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of pictorial and textual elements in digitized comics. While editing, marking up, and structuring texts and archival materials, we will be implicitly reading and subjecting them to a certain kind of interpretation, making inferences, and embarking in theoretical explorations of issues involved in the process. Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, occasional presentations and discussion leading, two papers, and a final project. The course is taught entirely in Spanish.

A major premise of the course is that intellectual capital businesses must be managed differently than capital intensive companies. One important difference is that gold collar workers (people whose value to the marketplace is their brainpower) and intelligent technology are the key corporate resources and major competitive weapons. Success also depends upon the organizations ability to create and acquire knowledge that can be easily stored, accessed, and synthesized. If (as the media tells us) knowledge is power, then harnessing this power through sound knowledge management techniques is essential for a brainpowered business.    The class will involve reading and discussion of relative uncharted topics, as well as areas of practical concern to the manager.    These topics may include:    What is Intellectual Capital and is it important?    What new rules drive brainpowered businesses, and how do these differ from the rules for managing traditional industrial or service firms?    How to think about and develop strategies for brainpowered businesses.    How to identify, attract, and retain gold collar workers.

Description: In designing computer systems one is usually constrained by certain performance requirements and limitations. For example, one might need to guarantee a response time SLA or certain throughput requirement, while at the same time staying within a power budget or cost budget. On the other hand, one often has many choices: One fast disk, or two slow ones? More memory, or a faster processor? A fair scheduler or one that minimizes mean response time? For multi-server systems, one can choose from a wide array of load balancing policies, a wide array of migration policies, capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies ... The possibilities are endless. The best choices are often counter-intuitive. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions before investing the time and money to build a system. This class will introduce students to analytic stochastic modeling with the aim of answering the above questions.

How do other syntactic relations connect with constituent structure? To the extent that there is mismatch between different notions of syntactic structure, how can it be reconciled within a theory of grammar?

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.

One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Decision Analysis is the prescriptive model for rationally maximizing subjective expected utility in the face of uncertainty; it is particularly powerful for dealing with sequential decisions, quantifying the value of information, assessing and incorporating subjective probabilities, and doing Bayesian updates of probabilities as new information becomes available.  Decision process considerations go beyond the paradigm of a single well-defined decision maker and mathematical method. Potential topics we could cover include industrial analytics, auctions, composite indicators (US News  World Report style ratings), balanced scorecards, dashboards of key performance indicators, group processes, and matching a decision method to the circumstances at hand.  *Please see course message for information about prerequisites*", "department": "Heinz College Wide Courses", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Decision Analysis and Multicriteria Decision Making", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A2", "times": [{"building": "HBH", "begin": "01:30PM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "2003", "end": "02:50PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}, {"building": "HBH", "begin": "03:00PM", "days": [5], "room": "1007", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Kweon, Sang Jin"]}, {"name": "B2", "times": [{"building": "HBH", "begin": "01:30PM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "1202", "end": "02:50PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}, {"building": "HBH", "begin": "03:00PM", "days": [5], "room": "1202", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Caulkins, Jonathan"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0, "sections": []}, "69-136": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "This course is designed to familiarize the student with the rules of basketball and to develop the skills needed to become proficient for recreational play.", "department": "Physical Education", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Basketball Skills", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A1", "times": [{"building": "GYM", "begin": "02:30PM", "days": [1, 3, 5], "room": "MGYM", "end": "03:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Hullah, Jacquie"]}, {"name": "A2", "times": [{"building": "GYM", "begin": "01:30PM", "days": [1, 3, 5], "room": "MGYM", "end": "02:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["VanGorder, Jeffrey"]}, {"name": "B1", "times": [{"building": "GYM", "begin": "01:30PM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "MGYM", "end": "02:50PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Hullah, Jacquie"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 3.0, "sections": []}, "92-892": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "N/A", "department": "Medical Management:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Enterprise Data Analytics", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A", "times": [{"building": "DNM", "begin": null, "days": null, "room": "DNM", "end": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Kurland, Kristen"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 4.0, "sections": []}, "57-151": {"prereqs": "57-153 or 57-150", "desc": "In Counterpoint in Theory and Application, students begin by learning the traditional five species of counterpoint in a tonal context.

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product -- devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development -- both of which are explored here.    We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included:  Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more.

To the extent that there is mismatch between different notions of syntactic structure, how can it be reconciled within a theory of grammar?

Space appears as something that exists around usour houses, our neighborhoods, our cities might seem like they are simply there to be moved through.

In the late 20th century, an interdisciplinary group that included geographers, urban studies scholars, architects, sociologists, anthropologists and literary theorists began to theorize the social construction of space.  They argued that space is something dynamically created that may be interpreted for the ways it creates meaning.

This interdisciplinary course considers theories of space and movement as a field of study and in reference to literary and film texts.

Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?  This course tries to address the above questions. In particular, the course begins by comparing early definitions of privacy to the current information-focused debate. It then focuses on:  - technological aspects of privacy (privacy concerns raised by new IT such as the Internet, wireless communications, and computer matching; tracking techniques and data mining; privacy enhancing technologies and anonymous protocols,), - economic aspects (economic models of the market for privacy, financial risks caused by privacy violations, the value of customer information, - legal aspects (laissez-faire versus regulated approaches, US versus EU legal safeguards,)   - managerial implications (the emerging role of Chief Privacy Officers, compulsory directives and self-regulative efforts, and - policy aspects (trade-offs between individual privacy rights and societal needs,)", "department": "Heinz College Wide Courses", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Privacy in the Digital Age", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A1", "times": [{"building": "HBH", "begin": "03:00PM", "days": [1, 3], "room": "1204", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Connell, Anne"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0, "sections": []}, "99-406": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "This course supports the development and improvement of the dozens of educational outreach endeavors implemented by university academic departments, student organizations and others.

The central subject of this course is process, not product. The programs that you will do are a means of teaching process, not an end product in themselves. The amount of process activity is clearly excessive for these simple problems. We suggest you read through all the programming problem specifications at the beginning so you will know where they are going early in the course. Then, when you feel that the process burden is too great, imagine doing a series of 300 line modules using the PSP, and see if you feel differently. We think that you will see the point very quickly and find yourself unconsciously applying parts of PSP to your own work before the course is done.  This course is intended for practicing software engineers and their managers. The measures introduced can serve as the basis for software development process improvement in the organization as well as helping individuals. Students who go on to take a more comprehensive course in the PSP will be able to concentrate more completely on advanced metrics and PSP is required if you intend to follow on with the concepts in the Team Software Process (TSP).  Requirement:  Since this is a development oriented class and involves writing code, all the normal tools one may use to develop code in their language of choice are required. You should NOT use this course as an opportunity to learn a new language as this course is intended to measure your already instantiated personal process.  Learning a new language will most likely cause you to change your personal process. Course requirements are not solely grounded in theory.

How do we take advantage of IT? In this course, we address three issues related to these questions.  1.      IT and Business Strategy: What is the role of IT in Business Strategy?  2.       Digital Goods Business: What is the nature of competition in digital goods market?  3.        IT and Firm Boundary: How does IT change Firm Boundary?  Our main objective is to understand the myriad linkages between IT and business strategy. We want to know how to align IT with business strategy?  How does IT transform business processes? What are the implications of IT outsourcing / crowd sourcing? Which IT investments are appropriate?  The bulk of class assignments are team-based. They include case analyses and a team presentation. The balance of the course grade will be determined by class participation and quizzes.

A very small number of these episodes change the way humanity views its ability to know the natural world and its place in universe.

By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia applications, music, responsive environments, video and sound installation, smart products, and beyond.  In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical point-of-view, developing tools that can be easily integrated into art-making using the graphical programming environment Max (a.k.a.

Muslim Migrations: Pre-Modern Era is one of a two-part series exploring the various contexts in which Muslim individuals and populations have migrated since the first migration from Mecca to Medina to the millions of Muslims on the move in the 21st Century. Whether journeying for the sake of learning, resources, or trade; or as the result of war, enslavement, or forced migration, Muslims migrating have had a profound impact around the globe.

The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic.

Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose?

Within months of the publication of the 95 Theses, this consensus began to crumble, and the very fabric of western culture was irrevocably altered.

Space appears as something that exists around usour houses, our neighborhoods, our cities might seem like they are simply there to be moved through.

In the late 20th century, an interdisciplinary group that included geographers, urban studies scholars, architects, sociologists, anthropologists and literary theorists began to theorize the social construction of space.  They argued that space is something dynamically created that may be interpreted for the ways it creates meaning.

In spite of some social division over these issues, governments at local, national, and international levels have made concerted efforts to craft policies to address climate change. These policies have shifted over time as the information, attitudes, and technology associated with climate change have evolved. In this course, we will explore the challenges and complexities of climate change by investigating the subject from a variety of angles: scientific, political, rhetorical, cultural, economic, technological, and ethical.

To intend a journey, is the translation of the Arabic word hajj; it describes both the actual trip through space undertaken by millions of pilgrims, and each ones personal, emotional reasons for migrating. Muslim Migrations: Pre-Modern Era is one of a two-part series exploring the various contexts in which Muslim individuals and populations have migrated since the first migration from Mecca to Medina to the millions of Muslims on the move in the 21st Century. Whether journeying for the sake of learning, resources, or trade; or as the result of war, enslavement, or forced migration, Muslims migrating have had a profound impact around the globe. This multidisciplinary course will explore the social, economic, environmental, and political dimensions of Muslims on the move. In this first 3.0 unit course, we will look at the pre-modern era from the 7th century to the mid 1800s, considering for example the impact of the hajj as the nucleus of thought, the expulsion of Muslims from Medieval Spain, and the forced migration of African Muslims during the trans-Atlantic slave trade to the Americas. The second part in the series will consider various migration trajectories in their colonial and post-colonial contexts, examining in particular the impact of WWI and WWII, histories of de-colonization, the Cold War contexts, and more recent wars, such as the US invasion in Iraq.", "department": "Carnegie Mellon University-Wide Studies", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Muslims in a Global Context: Muslim Migrations: Pre-Modern Era", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A2", "times": [{"building": "OFF", "begin": "05:00PM", "days": [5], "room": "PITT", "end": "08:30PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}, {"building": "OFF", "begin": "08:30AM", "days": [6], "room": "PITT", "end": "06:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}, {"building": "OFF", "begin": "08:30AM", "days": [0], "room": "PITT", "end": "01:00PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Mozisek, Korryn"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 3.0, "sections": []}, "45-822": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "Corporate Finance (45-822) is a case-based elective course that covers topics in capital budgeting, corporate valuation, payout policy, capital structure, and real options.

The model (or models) we will develop will be informed by the effects of coherence constraints in linguistic interpretation and in cognition. In the linguistic realm, interpretation typically involves constructing representations that are richer than the content that is linguistically encoded, and this enrichment is plausibly the result, in part, of the expectation of coherence. This expectation has far reaching effects, including on the assignment of referents to pronouns, the interpretation of definite and indefinite noun phrases, assignment of temporal relations, and the identification of Gricean conversational implicatures. In the cognitive realm, coherence is widely recognized as a factor in various learning  reasoning processes, including conceptual integration, belief adjustment, sequential decision-making, and even less rational processes such as rationalization.     In the first part of the seminar, we will develop an understanding of the linguistic and cognitive phenomena relating to coherence in its many manifestations. In the mid-part of the seminar, students will present models and frameworks of coherence from other fields, and examine ways to model various linguistic and cognitive phenomena using these approaches.

A first set of differences refers to ways in which management itself is conceptualized and taught, with a different emphasis given to some basic notions (e.g. the notion of leadership as opposed to a view of management as social practices; the role of goals versus processes). Moreover, serious variations in managing are related to the different role played by philanthropy, the market or the state: elements of public administration are needed to interact with these different contexts; different meanings assumed by cultural polices also need to be understood.

This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions", "department": "Tepper School of Business", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Pricing Strategy", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "A1", "times": [{"building": "POS", "begin": "10:30AM", "days": [2, 4], "room": "151", "end": "12:15PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Mehta, Nitin"]}, {"name": "E1", "times": [{"building": "POS", "begin": "06:30PM", "days": [1], "room": "152", "end": "10:00PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Mehta, Nitin"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0, "sections": []}, "04-801": {"prereqs": null, "desc": "Sec E1, D2", "department": "Information & Communication Technology", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "name": "Internet of Things", "coreqs": null, "lectures": [{"name": "D2", "times": [{"building": "CMR", "begin": "08:30AM", "days": [3, 5], "room": "C421", "end": "10:20AM", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "instructors": ["Mugume, Edwin"]}, {"name": "E1", "times": [{"building": "CMR", "begin": "05:00PM", "days": [3], "room": "C525", "end": "07:50PM", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "instructors": ["Ross, David"]}, {"name": "F1", "times": [{"building": "CMR", "begin": "08:30AM", "days": [1], "room": "C421", "end": "10:20AM", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "instructors": ["Mugume, Edwin"]}, {"name": "F2", "times": [{"building": "CMR", "begin": "01:30PM", "days": [1, 3], "room": "C421", "end": "02:50PM", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}, {"building": "CMR", "begin": "01:00PM", "days": [5], "room": "C421", "end": "02:00PM", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "instructors": ["Vernon, David"]}, {"name": "H2", "times": [{"building": "CMR", "begin": "04:30PM", "days": [1, 3], "room": "C421", "end": "06:20PM", "location": "Kigali, Rwanda"}], "instructors": ["Perkins, Michael"]}], "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0, "sections": []}, "54-273": {"prereqs": "54-158 or 54-272", "desc": "This course is an exploration of techniques and practices of the Technical Director.

Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.

The course instructor is one of those writers, having won three Game of the Year awards for his RPG stories and designs and then moved on to become a playwright, greatly influenced by his time Gamesmastering role playing games. The class will first examine and dissect RPG story and design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both design as well as storytelling best practices. Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic. The final product is a hard copy story bible portfolio-quality piece. The class grade will primarily be based on every students individual quality of writing and story crafting.

The answers to these questions, and others like them, require a detailed knowledge of the law and politics that lie behind the budget process, and the difficult policy choices that make up that process each year.   This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks. Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon. This sounds dull, but it isnt For good reason, people call Congress the worlds greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands. Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent.   Track II will introduce you in some of the important budget issues that have made life so difficult for Republicans and Democrats alike: working out an effective budget process, balancing the budget, funding budget priorities with limited resources, and deciding how much (and how) to tax workers and investors.   When we are working on Track II, you will develop two-pagers, the kinds of memoranda and statements written by congressional staff and political advisers.  This seminar will also assign teams to investigate selected budget issues (e.g., highway funding, defense procurement), and report back to the seminar with their findings and recommendations.

In early sixteenth century Europe, race was a complex system of power distribution that relied primarily on religious or rank-based difference. With the development of colonization and color-based slavery in the Atlantic world, the early modern racial matrix produced a new paradigm: Europeans started thinking about physiological difference - for which skin color was a shorthand - in racial terms too. How were those various racial paradigms (religion, rank, skin color) represented in one of the most important mass media of the time - theatre? How did those paradigms interact in one given play or one given national culture? Did they reinforce or work against one another? Which features were specific to nationally defined racial epistemes? Which features circulated across national borders? How did the translation and mistranslation of racial notions from one culture into another shape a sense of shared whiteness in early modern Europe? Which performance techniques did actors use to impersonate racial others, and what effect did those techniques have on spectators? In short, how did early modern theatre participate in the making of race? To answer those questions, we will focus on a rich corpus of plays staging Jews, Moors and Blackamoors, New World Indians, Gypsies, and Turks.
