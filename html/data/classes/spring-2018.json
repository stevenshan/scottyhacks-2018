What does scientifically based education research mean?  - Does it mean the sort of CMU-ish studies that cognitive and developmental psychologists do when they are interested in how students think about math or science or reading?  - Does it mean massive national randomized field trials on the effect of class size or teacher training or one curriculum versus another?  - Can it include non-experimental, qualitative, case studies and field demonstrations?  - Must it include new technologies that go beyond traditional teacher-student interactions?  2. What constitutes a treatment or an independent variable: lesson content, instructional method, teacher qualifications, student attributes,      educational ?philosophy?  ?approach? 3. What is the appropriate grain size of the measurements and analyses: individual students, classrooms, teachers, schools, school districts, states, nations?  4. How can research in cognitive science contribute to improving the science of education?  5. Can we point to examples that warrant the label of scientifically based education research, and can such research inform policy and practice in ways that have substantial impact?The course will include readings, discussions, invited expert speakers, and student research projects aimed at an important question about education.", "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "04:30PM", "building": "BH", "end": "05:50PM", "room": "342F"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Klahr, David"]}], "sections": [], "units": null, "name": "Scientific Research in Education", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "Psychology", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "18-999": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "Students will be apply to TA for this course after speaking with the Academic Services Center (coursehub@ece.cmu.edu) about any TAships which are not directly covered in the ECE TA Application Process.

Through screenings of acclaimed, international features and documentaries, class discussions, and workshops with award-winning filmmakers, students gain a basic foundation for film analysis.  Over the years, the festival has developed strong programming that has attracted internationally-renowned guests including Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme, Academy-nominated filmmaker Spike Lee, and the former First Lady of Poland Danuta Walesa.   The films are presented in conjunction with the 2018 Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival entitled Faces of (In)Equality.  Each film in this years lineup will explore international and contemporary issues surrounding the theme of (In)equality, including but not limited to gender, race, sexuality, and ethnicity, that are often hidden from mainstream media reporting. This course provides the rare opportunity to engage directly with the filmmakers, offering the chance to expand on the films controversial, global themes and learn more about the filmmaking industry and artistic process. Through viewing the films and learning from the filmmakers firsthand accounts, the students will hone their critical thinking skills and learn to read the mainstream media with a more discerning eye.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

Theoretical approaches include those that explore the role of the author, those emphasizing the workings of language, such as structuralism and post-structuralism, as well as those that underscore the relationship between texts and contexts, such as feminism, critical race theory, and postcolonial studies.

In studying development from the African womans perspective, one is better able to engage both the successes and failures of this formal process we call development in Africa. By examining African women and their relationship to this process, we will also see the alternative frames of feminisms and knowledges that emerge from these realities. The core questions driving this course are: (i) what are the various development ideologies and processes that have shaped contemporary Africa? (ii) How have African women adopted, rejected, and/or creolized these ideologies and processes for the purposes of changing their cultural, political, and economic conditions?

When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes. Highly innovative organizations develop new products and technologies guided in part by the patents and other technology rights that can eventually enhance value.

We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War politics influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law in order to garner international support.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to ones sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work: Aesthetics: The degree to which the design responds to formal issues as articulated in prior design studios. Structural System: The degree to which the proposed building is presented as a statically stable structure which defines the spatial order and satisfies the architectural intentions made explicit in the project. Enclosure System: The degree to which the proposed enclosure system satisfies the design requirements and responds to the physical phenomena of the environment into which it is placed.

Homework assignments will ask students to evaluate a business situation, make, and support their decision based on their analysis.", "prereqs": "95-715 or 90-723", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "10:30AM", "building": "HBH", "end": "11:50AM", "room": "2008"}], "name": "A4", "instructors": ["Pastor, Lynne"]}, {"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "09:00AM", "building": "HBH", "end": "10:20AM", "room": "2008"}], "name": "B4", "instructors": ["Pastor, Lynne"]}], "sections": [], "units": 6.0, "name": "Management Accounting", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["95-715", "90-723"]], "invert": false}, "department": "Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "19-785": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "This course introduces students to 1) the process of formally representing an engineering design or decision-making problem as a mathematical problem and 2) the theory and numerical methods needed to understand and solve the mathematical problem. Theoretical topics focus on constrained nonlinear programming, including necessary and sufficient conditions for local and global optimality and numerical methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems. Additional topics such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, global optimization, and stochastic methods are briefly introduced. Model construction and interpretation are explored with metamodeling and model reformulation techniques, study of model boundedness, constraint activity, and sensitivity analysis. Matlab is used in homework assignments for visualization and algorithm development, and students apply theory and methods to a topic of interest in a course project. Fluency with multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and computer programming is expected.

The approach used to account for these increasing market dynamics is sustainability analysis, a method that formulates product strategies according to their expected profit half-life. We begin by looking at the different ways a corporation can be structured to give it an advantage. These include degrees of vertical integration, ranging from fully integrated (complete ownership of all the stages of value added), to virtually integrated (where the various stages of the company are linked electronically without ownership). We also look at advantages to be had through horizontal integration (core competencies), where components of value from different products are shared to yield sideways economies of scale. We then look at traditional big business strategy, where economies of scale dominate along with continuous, controlled innovation; a process referred to as scale orchestration. These standard cycle examples include Toyota, Federal Express, McDonalds, Toyota, Starbucks, and Las Vegas Casinos. We next look at Schumpeterian markets, where rapid wealth creation is followed by the gale of creative destruction, which yields advantage that must be renewed rapidly.

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.  This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

The class consists of students from different disciplines who collaboratively synthesize and implement several systems in a short period of time.

Upon completion of this course the students will be able to: work in a mixed physical-digital environment and laboratory, make effective use of standard hardware and software tools for physical computing, approach complex physical computing problems with a systematic overview that integrates iterative research and design steps, generate systems specifications from a perceived need, partition functionality between hardware and software, produce interface specifications for a system composed of numerous subsystems, use computer-aided development tools for design, fabrication and testing and debugging, evaluate the system in the context of an end user application or experience.", "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "09:30AM", "building": "HL", "end": "11:20AM", "room": "A10"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Zacharias, Robert"]}], "sections": [], "units": 10.0, "name": "IDeATE: Introduction to Physical Computing", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "Art", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "54-208": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "This term is divided between two classic physical forms: Commedia dellArte and Clowns.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.

New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

This course is designed to introduce students to statistical analysis and modeling of experimental data that enables understanding of complex parameter spaces and makes predictions of future experiments using smaller datasets. Sample applications would cover systems in which patterns are evident but the rules cannot be reduced to simple deterministic equations, such as design of high-strength polymers, analysis of spectroscopic data on complex systems, producing 3D-printed constructs, and developing organic dyes. Course content will focus on introducing techniques useful for experimentalists who have generated small- or medium-sized datasets, including preliminary data analysis using principle component analysis or canonical correlation analysis, linear and nonlinear regressions, multivariate methods, graphical models, Bayesian models, and causal inference. In addition, basic machine-learning algorithms in the form of optimization methods will be explored as well as approaches for improving the graphical representation of data.

Pricing by replication is then considered in a one-period random model. Risk-neutral probability measures, the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing, and an introduction to expected utility maximization and mean-variance analysis are presented in this model.  Finally, replication is studied in a multi-period binomial model. Within this model, the replicating strategies for European and American options are determined. 3 hrs. lec.", "prereqs": "21-120 or 21-112", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3, 5], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "02:30PM", "building": "WEH", "end": "03:20PM", "room": "7500"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Handron, David"]}], "sections": [], "units": 9.0, "name": "Introduction to Mathematical Finance", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["21-120", "21-112"]], "invert": false}, "department": "Mathematical Sciences", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "79-393": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "This course will explore the history of the Catholic Church, with a particular focus on the church as an evolving European institution.

It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Module 2 covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homeworks requiring use or modification of Matlab scripts. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models.

This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it.

It is for those who want to express their interactive ideas in working prototypes. It will cover the importance of human-computer interaction/interface design, iterative design, input/output techniques, how to design and evaluate interfaces, and research topics that will impact user interfaces in the future. In lab, you will learn how to design and program effective graphical user interfaces, and how to perform user tests. We will cover a number of prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews of student work. This course is for HCII Masters students and HCI dual majors with a minimal programming background. Students will often not be professional programmers, but will need to interact with programmers.

We will use methods to learn who is using a website and why, and develop our toolset to test our decisions when implementing a new design. Along the way, we will develop and familiarity with the core web technologies of HTML5 and CSS3, with discussion of graphics, sound, social media, and other tools to enrich our presence on the World Wide Web.", "prereqs": "(76-270 or 76-271 or 76-272 or 76-101 or 76-102) and (51-261 or 51-262 or 76-382 or 76-391)", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "12:00PM", "building": "PH", "end": "01:20PM", "room": "A19D"}], "name": "Lec", "instructors": ["Mazaitis, Paul"]}], "sections": [{"times": [{"days": [2], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "06:30PM", "building": "WEH", "end": "07:50PM", "room": "5201"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Mazaitis, Paul"]}], "units": 12.0, "name": "Web Design", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["76-270", "76-271", "76-272", "76-101", "76-102"], ["51-261", "51-262", "76-382", "76-391"]], "invert": false}, "department": "English", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["76-488"]], "invert": false}}, "21-329": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "Set theory was invented about 110 years ago by George Cantor as an instrument to understand infinite objects and to compare different sizes of infinite sets.

It is a research experience intended to prepare international professional masters degree students in robotics for future entrepreneurial careers in their home countries. Its aim is less to require that they personally augment humanitys knowledge base, as would be required in an academic/research degree program, and more to teach them how to evaluate others research for its entrepreneurial potential, and to learn the process for transitioning it from a university lab to a position of economic value and social benefit. The five course modules of the sequence are identified as prepare, plan, execute, analyze, and present. Prepare  means to develop a high-level understanding of the research-with-a-goal architecting process. Plan means to identify, propose, and schedule the intended course of a specific project. Execute means to obtain data, preferably with an industrial sponsor identified in the plan  segment, but potentially alternatively in a university research lab.  Analyze means to draw defensible conclusions from the data, and accordingly to plan a commercialization route. Present is the professional programs alternative to a research thesis: students present their conclusions and future plans in several different formats each targeting a different clearly identified dissemination medium and audience interest, for example, written and orally presented versions of a professional magazine article, a trade show poster presentation, an engineering teams technical report, and a pitch to a venture capital source.", "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "04:30PM", "building": "GHC", "end": "06:20PM", "room": "4303"}], "name": "C", "instructors": ["Kantor, George"]}], "sections": [], "units": null, "name": "MS-RT Extended Project Course Sequence (EPCS)", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "SCS: Robotics", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "54-847": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "For Production Technology  Management majors.", "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [5], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "08:30AM", "building": "HL", "end": "12:20PM", "room": "106C"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Shackleford, Tina"]}], "sections": [], "units": 3.0, "name": "Graduate 30 Hour OSHA", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "Drama", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "90-989": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "The internship option offers PhD students the opportunity to supplement their research program.

Such questions can be addressed using Network Science. Network Science, a.k.a. social network analysis and link analysis, is a fast-growing interdisciplinary field aimed at understanding simple  high dimensional networks, from both a static and a dynamic perspective. Across an unlimited application space, graph theoretic, statistical,  simulation methodologies are used. An interdisciplinary perspective on network science is provided, with an emphasis on high-dimensional dynamic data. The fundamentals of network science, methods, theories, metrics  confidence estimation, constraints on data collection  bias, and key research findings  challenges are examined. Illustrative networks discussed include social media based (e.g., twitter), disaster response, organizational, semantic, political elite, crises, terror,  P2P networks. Critical procedures covered include: basic centralities and metrics, group and community detection, link inference, network change detection, comparative analytics, and big data techniques. Applications from business, science, art, medicine, forensics, social media  numerous other areas are explored. Key issues addressed: Conceptualization, measurement, comparison  evaluation of networks. Identification of influential nodes and hidden groups. Network emergence, evolution, change  destabilization.

What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.

Examples include the Shia-Sunni schism or split that has divided Islamdom since the first decades after the death of the Prophet founder in 632; the tensions between unity and sectarianism that relentlessly explode in Muslim countries; the persisting questions of equality and inequality that pertain to gender and race. The works of such historians as Muhammad ibn Ishaq of Medina (704-769), who authored an early biography (Sirat Rasul Allah, Life of the Messenger of Allah), Muhammad ibn Saad of Basra (764-845), who was inspired by Ibn Ishaq, the historian Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (839-923), who authored the multi-volume Tarikh al-rasul wa al muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings),and the 14th-century eminent thinker, Abu Zayd Muhammad Ibn Khaldun, who wrote the Muqaddimah, an Introduction to History, and numerous contemporary scholars help to elucidate part of the problems.

One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems.

Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design.

These psychological insights are particularly useful for marketing strategy, brand positioning, and marketing communication decisions, but also yield insight into common biases in judgment and decision making, beyond marketing, to which you would otherwise fall prey.  Why people are willing to drive across town to save 5 on a tank of gasoline, for example, when they would not drive a minute to save 5 on a refrigerator. We will discuss some of these applications in class.  In addition, we will examine the methodology of market research (specific to consumer behavior) to build the tools you will need to interpret and base decisions on it.", "prereqs": "70-381", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "01:30PM", "building": "WEH", "end": "02:50PM", "room": "5312"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Olivola, Christopher"]}], "sections": [], "units": 9.0, "name": "Consumer Behavior", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["70-381"]], "invert": false}, "department": "Business Administration", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}}, "11-929": {"coreqs": null, "desc": "This course number is intended for last semester Masters students who wish to do an optional Masters Thesis.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly.

Intonation and stress contribute to the interpretation of utterances in multiple ways. For example, the questions Did BOB go to the store? and Did Bob go to the STORE? contain the same words, but request different information. Similarly, whether the sentence Bob went to the store is interpreted as a statement or as a question, and whether as expressing certainty or uncertainty on the part of the speaker, depends on its intonation. Features of intonation can also convey information about the speakers attitudes and affect: sarcasm and irony, for example, may be signaled by intonation.   The goal of this course is two-fold. First, students will learn about the phonetic correlates of intonation and stress, and learn how to analyze intonation as a system of high and low tones, using the intonation transcription system ToBI.  This will enable students to accurately describe the intonation pattern of an utterance. Second, students will learn how intonation is used to convey semantic and pragmatic information. The course will focus primarily on English, but other languages will be explored to serve as a basis of comparison. There is no prerequisite, and no familiarity with either phonetics or semantics is assumed. The course will be of interest to students interested in learning some of the intricacies of face-to-face linguistic communication. Students in the departments of English, Modern Languages, Language Technology, Human-Computer Interaction, and Psychology will find material relevant to their major topics.

For writing majors, the course will increase their understanding of scientific research and how to describe it accurately and completely to a general audience. For science majors, this course will teach them how to craft fluid, powerful prose so that they can bring their disciplines to life. The course is not intended just for those who want to become science writers, but for anyone who may have the need to explain technical information to a general audience, whether it is an engineer describing a green building project at a public hearing, a doctor describing the latest research on a disease to a patient advocacy group, or a computer programmer describing new software to his firms marketing staff.   Scientists and educators today are increasingly concerned about the publics lack of understanding about scientific principles and practices, and this course is one step toward remedying that deficit.  Students will get a chance to read several examples of high-quality science writing and interview researchers, but the primary emphasis will be on writing a series of articles -- and rewriting them after theyve been edited. The articles will range from profiles of scientists to explanations of how something works to explorations of controversies in science.

How can a network be compromised or made resilient? Such questions can be addressed using Network Science.  Network Science, a.k.a. social network analysis and link analysis, is a fast-growing interdisciplinary field aimed at understanding simple  high dimensional networks, from both a static and a dynamic perspective.  Across an unlimited application space, graph theoretic, statistical,  simulation methodologies are used.  An interdisciplinary perspective on network science is provided, with an emphasis on high-dimensional dynamic data. The fundamentals of network science, methods, theories, metrics  confidence estimation, constraints on data collection  bias, and key research findings  challenges are examined.

Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms.  This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry.  Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly.

Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

This Digital Humanities/ Hispanic Studies course is aimed at examining representations of (super)heroes in Spanish, Latin American, and Latinx comics and graphic novels. What constitutes a (super)hero? Which cultural values does this type of character promote? What kinds of political societies do they appear in, and how do issues of gender, race, and ethnicity play out in these comics? In order to answer these questions, the course delves into a selection of popular comic books and graphic novels from the Spanish-speaking world, and provides the skills for reading these works critically as cultural artifacts in terms of what they depict and how they do so. We will also use these comics to develop a historical and theoretical exploration of Spanish, Latin American, and Latinx popular culture, narrative, history, and society. Analytic methods include hands-on instruction in Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, as one of the tools to encode and analyze the structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of these comics as documents combining pictorial and textual elements.

We explore the scope for interest rate policy to stabilize domestic employment and inflation against internationally transmitted macroeconomic shocks. [The two-country model is based on the closed-economy macro-model studied extensively in Economics 45-810, Money, Banking, and Financial Markets. The closed-economy model is included in the course packet for Economics 45-811, but it is not covered in class.]  We employ the two-country model to study i) the consequences of an inflation scare in a flexible exchange rate regime, ii) the nature of the 1997-98 east Asian currency crisis, iii) the implications of Chinas fixed exchange rate regime for trade and financial relations between China and the US, and iv) international adjustment problems within the Euro area.  We learn how the world achieved a working consensus on the core principles of monetary policy in the last quarter century. And we review actual Federal Reserve decision-making in detail since 1979 covering the Volcker disinflation and the Greenspan era.       We assess current macroeconomic stabilization problems involving i) politics, banking, and exchange rate policies in China, ii) the European Central Bank, banking, and fiscal policy in the Euro area, iii) capital inflows, exchange rate and inflation stabilization in emerging market economies and, iv) safe-haven capital inflows into Switzerland.
